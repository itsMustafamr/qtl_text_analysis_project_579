# QTL Text Analysis Project 1 - COMS 579

This project focuses on analyzing text from animal QTL-related papers. It includes text preprocessing, word cloud generation (using frequency and TF-IDF), Word2Vec-based similarity analysis, and phrase extraction. The final results involve extracting relevant domain-specific terminologies and matching them against a predefined trait dictionary.

To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qtl_text_analysis_project.git
cd qtl_text_analysis_project
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the dataset:
```bash
jupyter notebook preprocessing.ipynb
```

ðŸ“Š Results
The processed data, generated word clouds, and extracted trait terms are summarized in 579_report.pdf
